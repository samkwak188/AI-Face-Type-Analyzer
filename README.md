# AI Face Type Analysis 👤✨

I have created a web-based application that analyzes facial features to determine your Korean face type classification using machine learning. This is a incividual project I created for fun. This project used my previous Image Crawler code to collect the data from internet. 

## Overview 🎯

This project uses TensorFlow.js and Teachable Machine to analyze uploaded photos and classify them into four face types that are trending in Korea:
- 두부상 (Tofu Type)
- 두부모서리상 (Tofu Edge Type)
- 아랍상 (Hunter Type)
- 우유상 (Milk Type)

## Features 🌟

- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant face type prediction using TensorFlow.js
- **Bilingual Support**: Full Korean and English language options
- **Gender-specific Results**: Different celebrity examples based on gender selection
- **Responsive Design**: Works on webpages
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple upload and analysis process

## How to Use 📱

1. Visit the website (preferably on chrome browser)
2. Select your preferred language (Korean/English)
3. Upload a clear front-facing photo
4. Select your gender
5. Click "Analyze My Face!" button
6. View your results and matching Korean celebrities!
